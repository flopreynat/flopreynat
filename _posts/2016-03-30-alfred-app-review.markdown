An app all windows users envy us if they have had the chance to take Mac's already-powerful search feature to the next level, with Alfred - the award winning app and best butler I have ever known...

Like any developer out there, I want to use the keyboard as much as I can. For productivity reasons first, and for others.

Been using Alfred for years, and I can't get bored with it. Don't look at this post like an expert article on the subject, I have not even purchased the [Powerpack](https://www.alfredapp.com/powerpack/buy/), feature unlocking the likes of workflows, integrations, and even remote control to your IOS devices.
To be totally honest, I have never really looked into the Powerpack, but I may be tempted to leverage their integration with Asana, another must-have IMHO.

> It serves me right!

Anyway, for now, I use Alfred the most simple way ever, but it just works for me. Here are a few things you can do with Alfred:

+ Quickly find a file by typing "find" + the name of the file
+ Launch any app without using the mouse
+ calculate anything quickly by just typing numbers and operations
+ Launch a search on any site (eg. google, twitter, youtube etc)
+ Launch a google image search
+ Look up a place on Maps
+ Quit all apps at the end of the working day
+ Empty the recycle bin
+ etc...

You can easily configure your shortcuts and have for example "google" shortened to "g", and more.

In a nutshell, I love this app.
