1. You have [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) and use it on a regular basis?  
2. Your job is to build websites, or simple protoypes?
3. You're a fan of [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)?

Then you can leverage the power of Alfred's Workflow and use it on the fly when including font awesome parameters into your designs.

Simply donwload Alfred's [Font Awesome worklfow](https://github.com/ruedap/alfred-font-awesome-workflow#installation), and you're good to go.

Invoke the use of Alfred while designing (usually with 'ALT+ENTER'), type fa and search through the available icons, pick one and click 'ENTER', your class is in your design.
