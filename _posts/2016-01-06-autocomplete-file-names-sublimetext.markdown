Another cool add-on to your Sublime with this great little plugin that allows you autocompleting your file names and speed up your coding. 

Use your [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/) (CMD + SHIFT + P) to install AutoFileName and start playing with it.

> Autocomplete FTW!

Here's a quick gif to show the plugin's wonders.

Been using for a long time now, but I reckon it hasn't got the fame it deserves.

Kudos to [@boundincode](https://twitter.com/boundincode) (Liam Cain), the creator behind AutoFileName.
