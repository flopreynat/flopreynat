Already talked about this issue once... <a href="http://flopreynat.com/blog/macbook-pro-boots-to-black-screen.html" target="_blank">here</a>, except this time I don't have the chance to hear the startup chime, nor to reset any PRAM, nothing.

The only chance I get is to enter my password and see the apple screen get stuck for ever.

> SAFE MODE

Once I enter my password, the only thing I can do is press on the SHIFT key and hold it, until I enter the Safe mode.

At this stage, If you reboot, or try any disk utility, it should not fix the issue.
If you're lucky (like me), you'll have some software updates to install.

Launch the download/restart and install and hope for the best.
It did work in my case.
