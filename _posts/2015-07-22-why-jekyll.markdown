I've got it easy on that one. Site is brand new, hence built from scratch, with absolutely no data to migrate/integrate. Picking a technology like Jekyll to build and run this new personal pad was therefore an easy choice to make.

I've been using Wordpress (most times) and Perch (a few times) to create most of my personal/client/others' websites, and despite having nagged a few times about performance or bloated code, it was most of the time down to me.

Jekyll is however a static site generator, therefore no database, nor server-side languages are needed, which makes the site lightning fast, and bloody appealing for this particular use case...

Install was a bit of an experience, epecially if you don't really know what you're doing (like me). But since I managed to do it eventually, a fucking monkey would do it with one hand tied behind his back.

####Host it on Github

I can host all my stuff on Github and point my repo to a custom domain name in two moves, and I can enjoy what has been my dev workflow for quite a while (Like every modern developer out there, I've been versioning all my projects with git and Atlassian's [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/) for years).

It's early days but so far so good. Jekyll seems to be the perfect fit for any developer wanting to enjoy an easy CMS-like setup, just without all the fuss...
