'Have you documented your own Sublime Text shortcut cheatsheet?' is a question I never get asked. But despite all your efforts to avoid the subject, here it is. In your face!

This post is likely to get updated on a regular basis since I tend to learn new stuff every day. See, when you start low, you're bound to progress more often than never :)

So we've already spoken about [ST3's clipboard history capability](http://flopreynat.com/blog/sublimetext-clipboard-history.html). Here's the rest of the stuff I use on a daily basis.

<table>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>Command + click</td>
			<td>Multiple cursors</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Command + C/V</td>
			<td>(without selecting something) Copy/paste entire line</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Command + O/S/W</td>
			<td>Open/Save/Close file</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Command + Control + P</td>
			<td>Get List of Saved Projects</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Command + X</td>
			<td>Cut Line</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Command + D</td>
			<td>Grab similar occurences</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Command + Control + G</td>
			<td>Grab all occurences</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Command + Shift + F</td>
			<td>Find stuff through files & folders</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Command + K B</td>
			<td>Toggle sidebar</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Command + K L</td>
			<td>Go Lower case</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Command + K U</td>
			<td>Go Upper case</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Command + Shift + /</td>
			<td>Commenting/Uncommenting</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Command + Control + up/down</td>
			<td>Swap line order</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Alt + drag</td>
			<td>Initial a column select</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Command + Shift + left/right</td>
			<td>Select content from cursor to left/right end</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Control + Shift + W</td>
			<td>Wrap Line or Selection with Tag (absolute favourite)</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Command + Control + Shift +F</td>
			<td>Enjoy Distraction-free fullscreen</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Select + [/(</td>
			<td>Wrap selection between parenthesis/brackets</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>
