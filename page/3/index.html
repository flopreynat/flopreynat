            </h2>
            <div>
                <p>Repetitive strain injury (RSI) is a frequent issue when you spend 10+ hours a day in front of a computer, and it is something I have unfortunately been experiencing these last few years.
Since I own a mac, I have always been using a magic mouse, but as aching in my right hand (and arm) started to occur on a more regular basis, I started wondering whether this beautiful, yet - let&rsquo;s be honest - way too small device was the root of my problem.</p>

                <p>Staging environments are one of the keys of a (proper and) controlled deployment process, whatever the technology. Wordpress isn&rsquo;t any different.
You have a problem if you - like me - run a few things on wordpress, don&rsquo;t consider it as a priority subject (hence do not have the time, nor the money to commit on the suject), &hellip;yet still want to make it a decent process.
Typical &ldquo;have it both ways&rdquo; conundrum.</p>

                <p>Another blog post on Apple devices playing up (following the &ldquo;boot to black screen&rdquo; one) with this time, the way to resolve a frozen finder on OSX (Mavericks in my case).
The thing happened to me a few months back, with Finder freezing over and over after a few seconds or minutes of usage, forcing me to force quit Finder on numerous occasions throughout the day.
Fed up with this bug, and not willing to move away from the native file managing app, I eventually got it sorted out by simply using Mac&rsquo;s Safe Mode, something that Windows users might be more inclined to be using on a regular basis.</p>

Cut a long story short, you launch something along the lines of: &ldquo;grunt imagemin&rdquo; in your terminal, and you&rsquo;re thrown the following error:</p>

                <p>I&rsquo;m often being asked what screen recorder software I use, since I frequently document tutorials, emails, and other user guides with self-explanatory gifs.
And since the app I use is 1. open source (hence free), 2. super light, and 3. very easy to use, I thought I would give Licecap the credit it deserves.
As mentioned on the app&rsquo;s website, Licecap is a simple animated screen captures software. It probably has the least sexy logo ever, but the app is just great.</p>

 Autocomplete FTW!
 Been using for a long time now, but I reckon it hasn&rsquo;t got the fame it deserves.
