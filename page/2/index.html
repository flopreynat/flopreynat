                <p>So you&rsquo;ve decided to turn on two-factor authentication (as you do) for your github account and you can&rsquo;t commit (anymore) to your repos using the command line.
TL;DR
Create a personal token.
You won&rsquo;t be asked to provide a 2FA code when authenticating to GitHub on the command line using HTTPS URLs. Instead, you must create a personal access token and use its as a password.
 Log into your account Click on your avatar, then Settings Click on Developer Settings Choose Personal access tokens Generate new token Give your token a name Select the scope and permissions of your token Use your token as your password when prompted in the terminal  Done ;)</p>

                <p>Email design is a real pain in the arse. We all know that. Therefore I decided to give mjml a go. For those who don&rsquo;t know of mjml.io, it&rsquo;s a responsive email design framework built by a team of developers at Mailjet, a competitor of Mailchimp.
The beauty of this framework results in the fact that you create something very much close to html, using an MJML markup language, and as mentioned in its detailed documentation, &ldquo;its semantic syntax makes it easy and straightforward and its rich standard components library speeds up your development time and lightens your email codebase.</p>

                <p>New year new start. What a great opportunity to start it off on the right foot and greatly improve your behaviour and overall awareness on the personal data privacy subject. You will feel great and you will start breaking the chain!
As discussed last time we talked on the matter, our personal data privacy matters a lot, and yet, it is being violated more and more.
A quick glimpse at the news tell us the UK and Theresa May are trying to pass a law that will make it obligatory for internet providers to store every userâ€™s history for up to a year (although the text has just been declared unlawful by EU&rsquo;s Highest Court), or the German secret services are allegedly wanting to decrypt messengers like WhatsApp via the ANISKI project.</p>

This subject has always been of great interest to me, both from personal and technoligcal stand points. And as time passes by, and I see new generations of youngsters come into play, with absolutely no experience of what the time without the internet could have looked/felt like, it gets me thinking more and more about this situation, which I know isn&rsquo;t new, but is not getting any better to say the least.</p>
