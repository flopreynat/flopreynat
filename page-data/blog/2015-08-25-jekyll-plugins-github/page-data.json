When I decided to install and use <a href=\"https://github.com/UsabilityEtc/responsive-youtube-jekyll-tag\">the first of many plugins available</a>, I hit the wall and quickly realised the topic was far from an easy affair.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>tl;dr : Avoid using plugins if you can</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I'm not going to steal the words of David Lyons as he wrote a nicely-documented post on the subjet on <a href=\"http://www.sitepoint.com/jekyll-plugins-github/\">sitepoint.com</a>.</p>\n<p>To cut a long story short, Github only allows <a href=\"https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-plugins-with-github-pages/\">a few Jekyll plugins</a> to run during build process.</p>\n<p>As David mentioned it, you'll have a couple of work-arounds to get by.\nI personnaly decided not to go with any of them. </p>\n<p>First of all, the current (folder/git) structure setup suits me and I didn't want to disturb it. Second of all, I don't have the intention to add a million plugins (as in I intend to use none of them). Lastly, I am the only person operating this site and thought a bit of markup within the post would not be the end of the world, should I need to add a responsive-ready video container (<em>reminder: it's what I wanted to do in the first place</em>).</p>\n<p>Anyway, once again, read David's post. It's worth a look (and a thought) if you intend to host your Jekyll site on Github pages. </p>"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"2015-08-25-jekyll-plugins-github"}}}
