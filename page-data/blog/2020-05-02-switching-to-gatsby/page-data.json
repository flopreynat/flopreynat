But with the quarantine and lockdown ðŸ˜· fully enforced, I took the time to dig even more the static-site-generator subject, and decided to dedicate some time to learn <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/\">Gatsby</a>, an open source framework based on React (which I knew very little about), and apply my newly-acquired skills to the redesign of this very site. Job now done âœ…</p>\n<p><em>Note: React had always been a weird-looking beast to me, as I was struggling to grasp the concept/interest of injecting html inside javascript, but I am definitely getting it now.</em> </p>\n<p>I'm not going to detail here what it took me to switch to Gatsby. There are tons of ressources out there where you can get all the info you want. However I can only advise you to take <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t0vNu2fCCM\">Andrew Mead's Great Gatsby Bootcamp</a>, a close-to-5h top-notch tutorial taking you through the creation of a simple site equipped with a blog using Gatsby and either Markdown files or the now-popular headless CMS <a href=\"https://www.contentful.com/\">Contentful</a>.</p>\n<p>Gatsby has a starters library available at <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters/?v=2\">gatsbyjs.org/starters/</a> where you can easily get started with your Gastby project. It was however important for me to build my own Gatsby and Markdown starter, based on what I had been learning from Andrew's tutorial.</p>\n<p>You'll find <a href=\"https://github.com/flopreynat/myGatsbyMarkdownStarter\">my Gatsby Markdown starter</a> on Github, and as detailed in the README file, this starter will have the advantage of coming with:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Pages for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>home</li>\n<li>about</li>\n<li>contact</li>\n<li>blog</li>\n<li>404</li>\n<li>and the engine to generate one page/blog post</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>2 dummy posts, including one with an image</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://sass-lang.com/\">Sass</a> turned on</li>\n<li>the dotenv environment variable file for GraphQL Playground</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You'll also find on the repo's README the list of all the packages to be installed.\nPlease note that for the conversion of my site, I added the following packages:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/\">react-icons</a> to add social network icons to my footer</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/how-gatsby-works-with-github-pages/\">gh-pages</a> to allow deployment to Github's gh-pages, since my site is hosted there</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-image/\">gatsby-image</a> (+ gatsby-transformer-sharp gatsby-plugin-sharp), the recommended approach to handling images.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The redesign was a fun little adventure. Gatsby is awesome and I intend to use it for other ssg-powered sites. I did not experience any huge issues. Having given Andrew Mead's tutorial my full attention, things could not have been easier, that's why I recommend you take that course if you're a gatsby newbie.</p>\n<p><em>Tip: The only thing I had forgotten to do was to move the CNAME file to the static folder. So, if like me, you use a custom domain, do not forget to do that, or you'll lose the redirection of your github repo to your domain every time you'll run npm run deploy.</em></p>\n<p>So long folks.</p>"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"2020-05-02-switching-to-gatsby"}}}
