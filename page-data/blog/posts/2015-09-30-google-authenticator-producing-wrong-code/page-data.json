It usually involves a password and some kind of time-based token available via an app on a mobile phone.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>2-step verification is officially the best thing since sliced bread </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So by now, we all know we're talking about Google Authenticator. Great app, I use it all the time.</p>\n<p>Problem I just encountered: my mobile is in maintenance, and I bought myself a cheap Wiko for the few days/weeks to come, and I can not make the app work. No idea why, the time zone is set as it should, I ran a sync from the app, and it's telling me that all is fine.</p>\n<p>So what do you do in such a bizarre situation. I found my answer on a forum, but as there's not so much talk on the subject out there, this blog post may help some people stuck like me.</p>\n<p>Use this app: <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.fedorahosted.freeotp&#x26;hl=en\">FreeOTP</a></p>\n<p>It seems a bit strange to be using a google feature with an app made by Red Hat. But the app is legit and approved, and more importantly it works like a charm, ...even on a Wiko.</p>\n<p>And get yourself a decent phone though lol.</p>"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/posts/2015-09-30-google-authenticator-producing-wrong-code/"}}}
