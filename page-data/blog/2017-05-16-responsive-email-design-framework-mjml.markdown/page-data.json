We all know that. Therefore I decided to give <a href=\"https://mjml.io/\">mjml</a> a go. For those who don't know of mjml.io, it's a responsive email design framework built by a team of developers at <a href=\"https://www.mailjet.com\">Mailjet</a>, a competitor of <a href=\"https://mailchimp.com/\">Mailchimp</a>.</p>\n<p>The beauty of this framework results in the fact that you create something very much close to html, using an MJML markup language, and as mentioned in its detailed documentation, <em>\"its semantic syntax makes it easy and straightforward and its rich standard components library speeds up your development time and lightens your email codebase.\"</em></p>\n<p>MJMLâ€™s open-source engine, which is - by the way - written in <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/en/\">NodeJS</a> (hence easily installed via <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/mjml\">npm</a>), leverages ReactJS and takes your mjml email designs to process high quality responsive HTML compliant with best practices. That's the whole idea.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Easy and quick, Responsive, Component based</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As I had nothing much to work with for starters, I decided to use somebody else's work, and picked this beautiful minimalistic <a href=\"https://dribbble.com/shots/1518379-Newsletter\">newsletter</a> (designed by Dmitri Litvinov) I found on dribbble.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/mjml-dribbble-model.jpg\" alt=\"newsletter model\" title=\"newsletter model\"></p>\n<p>I won't go into the details of the design process but with the help of the doc, I put all the components together in a matter of minutes, generated the html template using the terminal and the follwowing syntax:</p>\n<pre><code>mjml yourfile.mjml\n</code></pre>\n<h4>Results</h4>\n<p>Here's the final result of my work in both gmail and protonmail.\nSomething not only esthetic but fully functional.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/mjml-results.jpg\" alt=\"mjml results\" title=\"mjml results\"></p>\n<h4>Verdict</h4>\n<p>If you're willing to send what looks like a professional responsive email, without having to use a third-party design service, then I defo advise you to give mjml a shot.</p>\n<p>So long.</p>"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"2017-05-16-responsive-email-design-framework-mjml.markdown"}}}
