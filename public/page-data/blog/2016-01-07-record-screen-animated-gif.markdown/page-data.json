It probably has the least sexy logo ever, but the app is just great.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Show, don't tell</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You open it, set your width, height, and click on record, and you're done. Stop it, and you'll get a nice looped gif file, you'll be able to paste anywhere.</p>\n<p>How neat is that?! I had always thought it was for mac only, but it was originally for windows environments, so all of you can have a go at this little app.</p>\n<p>Thanks to <a href=\"http://www.cockos.com/\">Cockos Incorporated</a> for this beauty.</p>"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"2016-01-07-record-screen-animated-gif.markdown"}}}
