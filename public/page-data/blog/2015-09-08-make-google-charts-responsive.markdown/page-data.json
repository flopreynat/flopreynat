Nothing close to rocket science but still useful.</p>\n<p>For those who don’t know, <a href=\"https://google-developers.appspot.com/chart/\">Google Charts</a> is a visualization tool, a gallery of interactive charts and data tools that you can integrate into your website. You provide data through php, json and Google Charts display it nicely for you.</p>\n<h4>Issue</h4>\n<p>By default, the charts come in the form of fixed width element which you can easily tweak to adapt to the now-famous ‘width:100%’ format. However the charts will only appear in that format when the page is loaded. They won’t dynamically resize when the browser window width is changed.</p>\n<h4>Solution</h4>\n<p>You will need to add a little jquery to get that to work as expected.</p>\n<pre><code>    $(window).resize(function(){\n        drawChart1();\n        drawChart2();\n    });\n</code></pre>\n<p>There’s obviously a <a href=\"http://codepen.io/flopreynat/pen/BfLkA\">codepen</a> for this.</p>"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"2015-09-08-make-google-charts-responsive.markdown"}}}
