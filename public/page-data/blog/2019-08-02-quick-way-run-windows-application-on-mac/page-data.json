In most cases, this will be way enough for you to test your application, and run your stuff.</p>\n<p>One thing you may need while you're playing with your windows machine, is to share things with your mac. Sharing folders between your machine and a VM is not native. Here's how you do it:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>In Virtualbox, select your VM, and go to Settings > Shared Folders, and add the folder (on your mac) you wish to use on your VM</li>\n<li>Then go to Settings > Storage and add an optical drive (+ and cdrom icon) to your IDE controller (choose 'Leave Empty')</li>\n<li>Start your VM</li>\n<li>In Virtulabox, go to Devices > Insert Guest Additions CD Image, and run the install program</li>\n<li>Once the program has been installed, reboot your VM</li>\n<li>That's it, ope file explorer, your file sharing folder should be appearing in there.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Hope this helps. </p>"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"2019-08-02-quick-way-run-windows-application-on-mac"}}}
