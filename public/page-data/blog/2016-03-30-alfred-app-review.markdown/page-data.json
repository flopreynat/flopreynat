For productivity reasons first, and for others.</p>\n<p>Been using Alfred for years, and I can't get bored of it. Don't look at this post like an expert article on the subject, I have not even purchased the <a href=\"https://www.alfredapp.com/powerpack/buy/\">Powerpack</a>, feature unlocking the likes of workflows, integrations, and even remote control to your IOS devices.\nTo be totally honest, I have never really looked into the Powerpack, but I may be tempted to leverage their integration with Asana, another must-have IMHO.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It serves me right!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Anyway, for now, I use Alfred the most simple way ever, but it just works for me. Here are a few things you can do with Alfred:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Quickly find a file by typing \"find\" + the name of the file</li>\n<li>Launch any app without using the mouse</li>\n<li>calculate anything quickly by just typing numbers and operations</li>\n<li>Launch a search on any site (eg. google, twitter, youtube etc)</li>\n<li>Launch a google image search</li>\n<li>Look up a place on Maps</li>\n<li>Quit all apps at the end of the working day</li>\n<li>Empty the recycle bin</li>\n<li>etc...</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can easily configure your shortcuts and have for example \"duckduckgo\" shortened to \"d\" (just an example).</p>\n<p>In a nutshell, I love this app. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.alfredapp.com/\">Alfred 2 for Mac</a></p>"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"2016-03-30-alfred-app-review.markdown"}}}
