Wordpress isn't any different.</p>\n<p>You have a problem if you - like me - run a few things on wordpress, don't consider it as a priority subject (hence do not have the time, nor the money to commit on the suject), ...yet still want to make it a decent process. </p>\n<p>Typical \"have it both ways\" conundrum.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>DEV > STAGING ENVIRONMENT > PRODUCTION</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Anyway, here are a few options, my views on them, and eventually a decision.</p>\n<h4>Professional Wordpress hosting (Paid)</h4>\n<p>Best option is to get people (or an app) meant to do this for you. Defo the best option if this subject is top priority for you. <a href=\"https://wpengine.com/support/staging/\">\"WPEngine\"</a> or <a href=\"https://mediatemple.net/community/products/wordpress/204645480/staging-sites-for-your-wordpress-hosting-service\">\"Media Temple\"</a> come to mind to name only a few.</p>\n<h4>WP Migrate DB Pro (Paid)</h4>\n<p>A popular plugin, often praised on <a href=\"http://shoptalkshow.com/\">\"ShopTalk Show\"</a>, <a href=\"https://deliciousbrains.com/wp-migrate-db-pro/pricing/\">\"WP Migrate DB Pro\"</a> is a great option to get your wordpress sites in sync (all content including media) with one click. Cool option to implement a push to production process. Starting at 89 box.</p>\n<p><em>Note: I ain't being sponsored for any of those paid options.</em></p>\n<p>As mentioned above, I can't be investigating any resource in this subject. Yet, I want to be able to set up a few environments and sync content and settings in an easy (and quick process), without having to deal with media url issues (cough wordpress import cough).</p>\n<p>Let me emphasize on the repeatable process here since I really want to be able to do more than the usual local wp-cloud wp sync'ing. Testing things as they live on the web has got to be a pre-requisite. Things happen differently when not happening on local machines.</p>\n<p>Anyway, I went with...</p>\n<h4>All-in-One WP Migration (Free)</h4>\n<p>As advertised, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/all-in-one-wp-migration/\">\"the plugin\"</a> allows you to export your database, media files, plugins, and themes. You can apply unlimited find/replace operations on your database and the plugin will also fix any serialization problems that occur during find/replace operations.</p>\n<p>Not bad for a free option, and works like a charm to get those wordpress environments in sync.</p>"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"2016-08-30-wordpress-staging-environment.markdown"}}}
