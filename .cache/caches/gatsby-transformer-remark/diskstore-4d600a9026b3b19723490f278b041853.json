Configuring and building the site is not very different from the workflow I used with Jekyll.</p>\n<p>I was convinced enough to make the leap and migrate my blog to Hugo. I doubt Hugo is as powerful as Jekyll, but it has all the things my minimalistic blog needs, especially the lighting speed it deserves.</p>"}
