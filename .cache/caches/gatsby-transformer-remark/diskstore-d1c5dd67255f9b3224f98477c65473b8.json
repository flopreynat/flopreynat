Even less php back end. Hence you've got to rely on other ways to get personal messages sent to you.</p>\n<h3>Formspree - Functional HTML forms</h3>\n<p>When I stumbled upon <a href=\"http://formspree.io/\">Formspree</a>, it did look like the perfect match. </p>\n<p><em>Side note: Kudos to the crew that put the site together. Minimalistic, straight to the point and no fuss around the subject.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Just send your form to our URL and we'll forward it to your email. No PHP, Javascript or sign up required â€” perfect for static sites!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, formspree is a tool apparently maintained by a community of developers, clearly stating no contents of the form submissions are stored (emails are sent using <a href=\"http://www.mailgun.com/\">Mailgun's API</a>). </p>\n<p>You do think about privacy, but not for long. First of all, you ain't giving much away, api or not. Folks are going to initiate discussions in a few words then you take over the talk, privately. No need to be paranoid... especially if (unlike me), you are giving away most of your life to facebook.</p>\n<h3>Easy peasy</h3>\n<p>Just follow the steps described. Everthing works as expected. Add form elements and don't forget to give them a name, they'll be automatically taken into account during form submission.</p>"}
