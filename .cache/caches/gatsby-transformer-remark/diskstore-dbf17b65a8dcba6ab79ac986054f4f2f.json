It's being used on both my desktop and mobile for a number of years.</li>\n<li><strong>Mail</strong>: Same applies to <a href=\"https://protonmail.com/\">Protonmail</a>, my favourite (open-source secured) email provider.</li>\n<li><strong>VPN</strong>: Since we're talking about the Proton team, let's give them another thumbs up with <a href=\"https://protonvpn.com/\">ProtonVPN</a> offering security, privacy for all, and freedom for journalists and activists.</li>\n<li><strong>SMS and calls</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.signal.org/\">Signal</a>. <em>Although I'm experiencing a few issues as I have started using dual-sim phone</em> , Signal has always been my preferred choice as its messages and calls are end-to-end encrypted. Switch to safe communications, people.</li>\n<li><strong>Browser</strong>: I use a mix of <a href=\"https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/\">Firefox</a>, <a href=\"https://brave.com/\">Brave</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/\">Tor</a></li>\n<li><strong>File hosting service</strong>: none. At the time I had pushed <a href=\"https://spideroak.com/\">Spideroak</a> as a great alternative to dropbox &#x26; co. I am not using this service since I actually have removed most of my problems by acquiring my own <a href=\"https://www.synology.com/en-global\">Synology NAS</a>. Having your own home server is a game changer.</li>\n<li><strong>Note taking</strong>: <a href=\"https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote\">Boostnote</a>, great app and open source project, soon to be coming as a mobile app (allegedely).</li>\n<li><strong>File synchronization</strong>: I currently use <a href=\"https://syncthing.net/\">Syncthing</a> as my tool of choice for synching my day-to-day files between my mac and my mobile.</li>\n<li><strong>To do app</strong>: I ditched asana for <a href=\"http://todotxt.org/\">todo.txt</a>. It has everything I need from tagging my tasks, give them a due date, and priority in the most simplistic way, and I use it with <a href=\"https://mjdescy.github.io/TodoTxtMac/\">TodoTxtMac</a> on my macbookpro, and <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.c306.ttsuper&#x26;referrer=utm_source%3Dtodotxt_website%26utm_medium%3Dcommunity_apps\">Todo.txt for Android</a> by Aditya Bhaskar. And obviously, I get my tasks synched via syncthing as mentioned above.</li>\n<li><strong>Video Streaming</strong>: I'd love not to be using Youtube but since there are so much great content in there, I use <a href=\"https://newpipe.schabi.org/\">Newpipe</a> on my Android (NewPipe only parses the YouTube website in order to gain the information it needs) and <a href=\"https://freetubeapp.io/\">Freetube</a>, a YouTube client for Windows, Mac, and Linux built around using YouTube more privately.</li>\n<li><strong>2FA</strong>: I ditched google authenticator to use <a href=\"https://freeotp.github.io/\">Freeotp</a>.\t</li>\n<li><strong>Navigation</strong>: I ditched google maps and waze to use <a href=\"https://osmand.net/\">OsmAnd</a>. It's great for Map Viewing and Navigation for both Online and Offline. I like the vintage look and feel and amount of details in there.</li>\n<li><strong>RSS</strong>: The good ol' days of leveraging RSS technology should never have disappeared. But it (stangely) is what occurred in my case. I'm back at it, and I use <a href=\"https://www.vienna-rss.com/\">Vienna RSS</a> for this. Great native macOS Open Source project, that gets the info to me, as opposed to go get it and get tracked.</li>\n<li><strong>Office softwares</strong>: I've moved away from google docs/sheets/slides to <a href=\"https://www.libreoffice.org/\">Libre Office</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Other softwares</strong>: I make the most of the <a href=\"https://framalibre.org/annuaires/logiciel\">Framalibre software alternatives</a> by the great <a href=\"https://framasoft.org/en/\">Framasoft</a>, and use as a few examples: <a href=\"https://jitsi.org/\">Jitsi</a> instead of Hangouts/Skype, <a href=\"https://framadate.org/\">Framadate</a> instead of doodle.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Yet to test (mytodo)</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Password manager</strong>: <a href=\"https://bitwarden.com/\">Bitwarden</a> which I would like to test self-hosted. I'm on another password manager app at the moment, but switching to an open-source solution would be nice.</li>\n</ul>"}
