This is why I moved to 'verticality' 6 months ago, with the purchase of a basic <a href=\"https://www.amazon.fr/gp/product/B00D84P8O8/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o07_s00?ie=UTF8&#x26;psc=1\">usb vertical mouse ZeleSouris</a>.</p>\n<p>A few reasons why I picked this low-budget mouse:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>this was going to be more like a pilot phase (so I thought)</li>\n<li>non-wireless mice are less heavy (no batteries), hence easier to move</li>\n<li>this specific device was not pricy hence more than worth a shot</li>\n</ul>\n<p>6 months on and I have to admit this was the best choice ever. Getting used to it took only a few days as far as I was concerned. I doubt the mouse I picked is the best ever, but my RSI has gone for now.</p>\n<p>I can only advise you to ditch the good looks of the magic mouse for an old bulky mouse, a trackpad or a vertical mouse, should you suffer (or wish to prevent) from RSI.</p>"}
