No sweat.</p>\n<p>But I can't blame as this is just what happened to me today while working on a website redesign. The grunt task is a simple 'imagemin' task I decided to run separately, and I don't recall having had the same issue before.</p>\n<p>Cut a long story short, you launch something along the lines of:\n\"grunt imagemin\" in your terminal, and you're thrown the following error:</p>\n<pre><code>RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded\n</code></pre>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Don't name your task aliases like your tasks</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I did not find the issue in Grunt's documentation but managed to find it in my search results.</p>\n<p>You can not name your tasks like the task itself, <a href=\"http://gruntjs.com/frequently-asked-questions#why-am-i-getting-a-maximum-call-stack-size-exceeded-error\">as detailed here</a>. </p>\n<p>So I went from:</p>\n<pre><code>grunt.registerTask(\"imagemin\", [\"imagemin\"]);\n</code></pre>\n<p>to </p>\n<pre><code>grunt.registerTask(\"imageminifier\", [\"imagemin\"]);\n</code></pre>\n<p>... and it worked like a charm.</p>"}
