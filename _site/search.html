VIRTUALIZATION TIMEThe quickest and easisest way (to me) is to use Virtualbox (open source and free), download a free virtual Windows machine from the Microsoft developer website, and spin it.So, ok, those virtual machines expire after 90 days. In most cases, this will be way enough for you to test your application, and run your stuff.One thing you may need while you’re playing with your windows machine, is to share things with your mac. Sharing folders between your machine and a VM is not native. Here’s how you do it:  In Virtualbox, select your VM, and go to Settings &gt; Shared Folders, and add the folder (on your mac) you wish to use on your VM  Then go to Settings &gt; Storage and add an optical drive (+ and cdrom icon) to your IDE controller (choose ‘Leave Empty’)  Start your VM  In Virtulabox, go to Devices &gt; Insert Guest Additions CD Image, and run the install program  Once the program has been installed, reboot your VM  That’s it, ope file explorer, your file sharing folder should be appearing in there.Hope this helps.",

For those who don’t know of mjml.io, it’s a responsive email design framework built by a team of developers at Mailjet, a competitor of Mailchimp.The beauty of this framework results in the fact that you create something very much close to html, using an MJML markup language, and as mentioned in its detailed documentation, “its semantic syntax makes it easy and straightforward and its rich standard components library speeds up your development time and lightens your email codebase.”MJML’s open-source engine, which is - by the way - written in NodeJS (hence easily installed via npm), leverages ReactJS and takes your mjml email designs to process high quality responsive HTML compliant with best practices. That’s the whole idea.  Easy and quick, Responsive, Component basedAs I had nothing much to work with for starters, I decided to use somebody else’s work, and picked this beautiful minimalistic newsletter (designed by Dmitri Litvinov) I found on dribbble.I won’t go into the details of the design process but with the help of the doc, I put all the components together in a matter of minutes, generated the html template using the terminal and the follwowing syntax:mjml yourfile.mjmlResultsHere’s the final result of my work in both gmail and protonmail. Something not only esthetic but fully functional.VerdictIf you’re willing to send what looks like a professional responsive email, without having to use a third-party design service, then I defo advise you to give mjml a shot.So long.",

              "content": "New year new start. What a great opportunity to start it off on the right foot and greatly improve your behaviour and overall awareness on the personal data privacy subject. You will feel great and you will start breaking the chain!As discussed last time we talked on the matter, our personal data privacy matters a lot, and yet, it is being violated more and more.A quick glimpse at the news tell us the UK and Theresa May are trying to pass a law that will make it obligatory for internet providers to store every user’s history for up to a year (although the text has just been declared unlawful by EU’s Highest Court), or the German secret services are allegedly wanting to decrypt messengers like WhatsApp via the ANISKI project. Mass surveillance is a hot topic, and defo on the rise these days.Big Deal, I have nothing to hide.Killing the ‘nothing to hide’ argument is probably the easiest thing in the world, so try it yourselves (just for fun) if an idiot tells you he/she has nothing to hide, with this set of decent questions/requests I heard a few folks suggest.  “Why the fuck do you have curtains in your house?”  “Hand me all your passwords if you have fuck all to hide then.”  “Give me your bank receipts of last year, since there’s nothing spectacular in there.”  Bottom line is: I don’t have anything to hide. But I don’t have anything I feel like showing you, either.So Why is Mass Surveillance wrong?  it invades our private life space  we have absolutely no control of what is being recorded  nor how long it is being stored  it might not reflect reality  it might reflect the reality and we might not want to let people know things  it inhibits free speech  it inhibits free association  it puts free press in real danger  it kills creativity  it has yet to be proved successful in the fight against terrorismThe thing is, …this is far from new.As discussed in this series’ first post, people farming, or automated data processing by the likes of facebook, google and the rest is not only something we signed for (by agreeing to the unread and unreadable services’ terms and conditions), but something we have absolutely accepted as THE standard web app model. As in free but far from private.Examples are countless, but to name only one, feel free to check Über’s latest terms of use update, where you grant Über a worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, transferable, royalty-free license, with the right to sublicense, to use, copy, modify, create derivative works of, distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, and otherwise exploit in any manner any User Content.Talking about Big Brothers, you will also enjoy those quotes from a Google executive, stating “Google policy is to get right up to the creepy line and not cross it”, or even “With your permission you give us more information about you, about your friends, and we can improve the quality of our searches […] We don’t need you to type at all.”In addition, and as stated in a court filing, “all users of email must necessarily expect that their emails will be subject to automated processing. Just as a sender of a letter to a business colleague cannot be surprised that the recipient’s assistant opens the letter, people who use web-based email today cannot be surprised if their emails are processed by the recipient’s [email provider] in the course of delivery.”OK, so Google is kind of reading your emails, facebook is recording everything you do/post/interact with for ever, and even if you don’t use those services, you are being followed by countless trackers anywhere you go on the web. Not aware of this? Check out the Do not track series, they surely will entertain you.So…Any solutions out there?As clearly stated by Aral Balkan in his talk, regulation, legislation, and ethical design are indeed the answers.But while waiting for our constitution reps to dump lobbyists and defend our digital rights, let’s do our part.  Let’s do our part and break the chain  Do not use Facebook/Gmail/etc… if you can  If you can’t, Do not put your whole life on Facebook, Twitter, etc…  Use DuckDuckGo as default search engine, as they don’t track you  Block laptop camera + laptop microphone if you are not using them  Turn off location on your mobile phone as much as you can  Turn off your phone at night  Use Tor as much as you can on your desktop  Use Orbot (and hence Orfox) as much as you can on your android if you have one  If you don’t have enough patience, use Mozilla’s Firefox as default browser. Ok they get funded by the other big guns I’m talking about (as they need mozilla’s search traffic). But they’re non profit, big on privacy and encryption, so let’s give them credit.  Block trackers (Better from Indie for Safari, uBlock Origin or Ghostery… although I’m hearing things about Ghostery selling their stats back)  Get a Protonmail account ffs! Paying a small amount for private email is good for you, and a very decent model  Use Spideroak for cloud storage  Use Signal from Open Whisper Systems for encrypted text messaging  Use Framatalk or similar tool for video conference  and probably the most important part of all:PASS THIS BLOODY MESSAGE ONTO YOUR FRIENDS AND RELATIVES !!Otherwise, happy new year!Publicly yours.",

DANGER MOUSE !Discussing the matter with my osteopath quickly led to the option of using a vertical mouse, helping you  keep your hand in a natural position. This is why I moved to ‘verticality’ 6 months ago, with the purchase of a basic “usb vertical mouse ZeleSouris”.A few reasons why I picked this low-budget mouse:  this was going to be more like a pilot phase (so I thought)  non-wireless mice are less heavy (no batteries), hence easier to move  this specific device was not pricy hence more than worth a shot6 months on and I have to admit this was the best choice ever. Getting used to it took only a few days as far as I was concerned.

DEV &gt; STAGING ENVIRONMENT &gt; PRODUCTIONAnyway, here are a few options, my views on them, and eventually a decision.Professional Wordpress hosting (Paid)Best option is to get people (or an app) meant to do this for you. Defo the best option if this subject is top priority for you. “WPEngine” or “Media Temple” come to mind to name only a few.WP Migrate DB Pro (Paid)A popular plugin, often praised on “ShopTalk Show”, “WP Migrate DB Pro” is a great option to get your wordpress sites in sync (all content including media) with one click. Cool option to implement a push to production process. Starting at 89 box.Note: I ain’t being sponsored for any of those paid options.As mentioned above, I can’t be investigating any resource in this subject. Yet, I want to be able to set up a few environments and sync content and settings in an easy (and quick process), without having to deal with media url issues (cough wordpress import cough).Let me emphasize on the repeatable process here since I really want to be able to do more than the usual local wp-cloud wp sync’ing. Testing things as they live on the web has got to be a pre-requisite. Things happen differently when not happening on local machines.Anyway, went with…All-in-One WP Migration (Free)As advertised, “the plugin” allows you to export your database, media files, plugins, and themes. You can apply unlimited find/replace operations on your database and the plugin will also fix any serialization problems that occur during find/replace operations.Not bad for a free option, and works like a charm to get those wordpress environments in sync.",

Safe Mode babyI personnally had never used the safe mode before, despite around 10 years on apple.So if you have a frozen Finder, go for it…Follow these steps to start up into safe mode.  Start or restart your Mac.  Immediately after you hear the startup sound, press and hold the Shift key.  Release the Shift key when you see the Apple logo appear on the screen.After the Apple logo appears, it might take longer than usual to reach the login screen or your desktop. This is because your Mac performs a directory check of your startup disk as part of safe mode.To leave safe mode, restart your computer without pressing any keys during startup.(Taken from “Apple Support website”)",

It serves me right!Anyway, for now, I use Alfred the most simple way ever, but it just works for me. Here are a few things you can do with Alfred:  Quickly find a file by typing “find” + the name of the file  Launch any app without using the mouse  calculate anything quickly by just typing numbers and operations  Launch a search on any site (eg. google, twitter, youtube etc)  Launch a google image search  Look up a place on Maps  Quit all apps at the end of the working day  Empty the recycle bin  etc…You can easily configure your shortcuts and have for example “google” shortened to “g” (just an example).In a nutshell, I love this app.Alfred 2 for Mac",

              "content": "So you got yourself a nice static site, and you want to give your audience a chance to talk to you (directly) with a simple contact form, something you might be used to having used wordpress, php, and a database.Except there ain’t no database here. Even less php back end. Hence you’ve got to rely on other ways to get personal messages sent to you.Formspree - Functional HTML formsWhen I stumbled upon Formspree, it did look like the perfect match.Side note: Kudos to the crew that put the site together. Minimalistic, straight to the point and no fuss around the subject.  Just send your form to our URL and we’ll forward it to your email. No PHP, Javascript or sign up required — perfect for static sites!So, formspree is a tool apparently maintained by a community of developers, clearly stating no contents of the form submissions are stored (emails are sent using Mailgun’s API).You do think about privacy, but not for long. First of all, you ain’t giving much away, api or not. Folks are going to initiate discussions in a few words then you take over the talk, privately. No need to be paranoid… especially if (unlike me), you are giving away most of your life to facebook.Easy peasyJust follow the steps described. Everthing works as expected. Add form elements and don’t forget to give them a name, they’ll be automatically taken into account during form submission.",

Picking a technology like Jekyll to build and run this new personal pad was therefore an easy choice to make.I’ve been using Wordpress (most times) and Perch (a few times) to create most of my personal/client/others’ websites, and despite having nagged a few times about performance or bloated code, it was most of the time down to me.Jekyll is however a static site generator, therefore no database, nor server-side languages are needed, which makes the site lightning fast, and bloody appealing for this particular use case…  Transform your plain text into static websites and blogsInstall was a bit of an experience, epecially if you don’t really know what you’re doing (like me). But since I managed to do it eventually, a fucking monkey would do it with one hand tied behind his back.Host it on GithubI can host all my stuff on Github and point my repo to a custom domain name in two moves, and I can enjoy what has been my dev workflow for quite a while (Like every modern developer out there, I’ve been versioning all my projects with git and Atlassian’s Bitbucket for years).It’s early days but so far so good. Jekyll seems to be the perfect fit for any developer wanting to enjoy an easy CMS-like setup, just without all the fuss…",

              "author": "flo preynat",
              "category": "design",
              "content": "Last time I talked about responsive images, I did mention I was due to go to the responsive images meetup in Paris, and as the long-awaited event happened a couple of days ago, I thought it would be nice to write a quick recap for the folks unable to make it.SIDE NOTEBefore we get to the the nitty gritty, let me start this blog post with a quick line on the venue. The meetup took place in Mozilla’s Paris headquarters, a superb office located boulevard Montmartre, in Paris’ 9th arrondissement. What a place this is! Two snaps for your eyes.Mozilla really know how to welcome guests. Just saying.HIGH HOPESHaving received a teasing email from Yoav a couple of days prior to the get-together, and seen a number of known representatives from Apple, Google, Mozilla, Microsoft and Adobe inked on the presence sheet (unfortunately Bruce Lawson from Opera was unable to make it), I was very much looking forward to this event. After all, the web community (especially the developers) had been waiting over two years for some clear stand on the subject of responsive images from the big players, while, in the mean time, and according to the latest stats, 72% of responsive websites were still serving the same amount of data to ANY device.USE CASESThe day started off with a pre-recorded presentation of the problem at hand from RICG‘s front man Mat Marquis, and we quickly went to real case uses with an overview of the BBC and Akamai’s ways of handling the issue.Very interesting to see what large scale companies had been implementing, especially since the BBC and its 83 millions monthly views (2.6 millions views per day), as Mark McDonnell explained, had been using none of the so-far-proposed solutions , but ‘a form’ of javascript-dependent responsive image system. Lightweight, fast working on all devices solution, and implemented since 2011.I can only invite you to take a look at their project. The javascript is open-sourced and available on Github.Next, Guy Podjarny took the stand to explain Akamai’s sophisticated content delivery acceleration techniques including smart delivery (with Edge Device Characterization) using patterns of characteristics drawn from a database of mobile devices, front-end optimization, the still-in-beta image converter allowing art direction, and adaptive image compression taking into account the network conditions to define the quality of the served content.Quite a setup. Defo out of my league, and certainly destined to large scale sites. In a nutshell, not exactly what you would use to build the website of your local pub.A LOOK BACK AT THE PROPOSED SOLUTIONSDPR switching, Viewport switching and Art direction on our minds, and a few coffees down our throats, we went ahead and reviewed the proposed solutions.Apple’s Theresa O’Connor presented the srcset attribute, which defines the various image resources to be used, and the clues to help a user agent determine the most appropriate one to display, already implemented (at least a limited version of it) by webkit.&lt;img alt=\"The Breakfast Combo\"src=\"banner.jpeg\"srcset=\"banner-HD.jpeg 2x, banner-phone.jpeg 100w, banner-phone-HD.jpeg 100w 2x\"&gt;The picture element presented by Mozilla’s Marcos Caceres, defining a declarative solution for grouping multiple versions of an image based on different criteria (format, resolution, orientation, and more), allowing the user agent to select the optimum image to be presented while providing the best solution (so far) for art direction.&lt;picture width=\"500\" height=\"500\"&gt;   &lt;source media=\"(min-width: 45em)\" src=\"large.jpg\"&gt;   &lt;source media=\"(min-width: 18em)\" src=\"med.jpg\"&gt;   &lt;source src=\"small.jpg\"&gt;   &lt;img src=\"small.jpg\" alt=\"\" lazyload&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Accessible text&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;‘HTTP Client Hints’ presented by Google’s Ilya Grigorik, which defines a set of HTTP headers allowing browsers to indicate a list of device and agent specific preferences, and drive servers to use these “client hints” to assist in content negotiation.Ideal solution as the content served would match the environmental conditions of the client, ideal in the minimal developer effort sense (I knew you would love that one!), and also ideal as far as semantic is concerned (ie. a simple image tag ).But… we would need to use a new header where we would define the devicePixelRatio (DPR) of the terminal (e.g. CH: dpr=2) to pass the relevant info to the server, the current UA header being unable to do that. More on client hints here.The ‘SVG’s Switch element’ presented by W3C’s Robin Berjon, a solution already well supported today, already offering a built-in, working fallback. See his full presentation here.&lt;switch alt=\"Accessible text\"&gt;     &lt;img media=\"(min-width: 45em)\" src=\"large.jpg\"&gt;     &lt;img media=\"(min-width: 18em)\" src=\"med.jpg\"&gt;     &lt;img src=\"small.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/switch&gt;‘New Image Format’ presented by Yoav Weiss, a responsive image container containing internal layers which uses resizing and crop operations to deal with both resolution switching and art direction. In a nutshell, the encoder takes the original picture, the required output resolutions and if needed art direction pre-requisites, and outputs a layer per resolution.As a picture is worth a thousand words, there you go:WHAT NOW?DPR switching definitely seems to have made the top of the vast responsive images todo list. I have to admit I freaking love the concept of client hints presented by Ilya, but Google will certainly need an ally if we are to go this way… and it doesn’t look like it could be Mozilla, David Baron having shown little enthusiasm (to say the least) to go ahead and add more (unremovable) HTTP headers.The ‘srcset attribute’ and the ‘Picture element’ will make last call, and will definitely keep on getting tested. Both could emerge winners, srcset for its simplicity, and picture for its art direction friendliness, a popular aspect in the developers community.Expect some simplification in the markup, and a likely removal of possibly w and more likely h from the spec.Microsoft could have a card to play in this debate, with IE12 in the box, and a strong and obvious interest from Lead Principal Program Manager Israel Hilerio.FINAL WORDSA huge bravo to Marcos and Yoav for getting a crowd of proactive folks and professionals going for eight hours straight, on the sole subject of responsive images. And a massive ‘thank you’ for opening the doors to smaller companies and freelancers.Getting together is already a huge success, working together is the next step forward.",
