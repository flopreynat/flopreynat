DEV &gt; STAGING ENVIRONMENT &gt; PRODUCTIONAnyway, here are a few options, my views on them, and eventually a decision.Professional Wordpress hosting (Paid)Best option is to get people (or an app) meant to do this for you. Defo the best option if this subject is top priority for you. “WPEngine” or “Media Temple” come to mind to name only a few.WP Migrate DB Pro (Paid)A popular plugin, often praised on “ShopTalk Show”, “WP Migrate DB Pro” is a great option to get your wordpress sites in sync (all content including media) with one click. Cool option to implement a push to production process. Starting at 89 box.Note: I ain’t being sponsored for any of those paid options.As mentioned above, I can’t be investigating any resource in this subject. Yet, I want to be able to set up a few environments and sync content and settings in an easy (and quick process), without having to deal with media url issues (cough wordpress import cough).Let me emphasize on the repeatable process here since I really want to be able to do more than the usual local wp-cloud wp sync’ing. Testing things as they live on the web has got to be a pre-requisite. Things happen differently when not happening on local machines.Anyway, went with…All-in-One WP Migration (Free)As advertised, “the plugin” allows you to export your database, media files, plugins, and themes. You can apply unlimited find/replace operations on your database and the plugin will also fix any serialization problems that occur during find/replace operations.Not bad for a free option, and works like a charm to get those wordpress environments in sync.",

Safe Mode babyI personnally had never used the safe mode before, despite around 10 years on apple.So if you have a frozen Finder, go for it…Follow these steps to start up into safe mode.  Start or restart your Mac.  Immediately after you hear the startup sound, press and hold the Shift key.  Release the Shift key when you see the Apple logo appear on the screen.After the Apple logo appears, it might take longer than usual to reach the login screen or your desktop. This is because your Mac performs a directory check of your startup disk as part of safe mode.To leave safe mode, restart your computer without pressing any keys during startup.(Taken from “Apple Support website”)",

Don’t look at this post like an expert article on the subject, I have not even purchased the Powerpack, feature unlocking the likes of workflows, integrations, and even remote control to your IOS devices.To be totally honest, I have never really looked into the Powerpack, but I may be tempted to leverage their integration with Asana, another must-have IMHO.  It serves me right!Anyway, for now, I use Alfred the most simple way ever, but it just works for me. Here are a few things you can do with Alfred:  Quickly find a file by typing “find” + the name of the file  Launch any app without using the mouse  calculate anything quickly by just typing numbers and operations  Launch a search on any site (eg. google, twitter, youtube etc)  Launch a google image search  Look up a place on Maps  Quit all apps at the end of the working day  Empty the recycle bin  etc…You can easily configure your shortcuts and have for example “google” shortened to “g” (just an example).In a nutshell, I love this app.Alfred 2 for Mac",

When I decided to install and use the first of many plugins available, I hit the wall and quickly realised the topic was far from an easy affair.  tl;dr : Avoid using plugins if you canI’m not going to steal the words of David Lyons as he wrote a nicely-documented post on the subjet on sitepoint.com.To cut a long story short, Github only allows a few Jekyll plugins to run during build process.As David mentioned it, you’ll have a couple of work-arounds to get by.I personnaly decided not to go with any of them.First of all, the current (folder/git) structure setup suits me and I didn’t want to disturb it. Second of all, I don’t have the intention to add a million plugins (as in I intend to use none of them). Lastly, I am the only person operating this site and thought a bit of markup within the post would not be the end of the world, should I need to add a responsive-ready video container (reminder: it’s what I wanted to do in the first place).Anyway, once again, read David’s post. It’s worth a look (and a thought) if you intend to host your Jekyll site on Github pages.",

The latest version is now more than mature (hence my move) and has additional features ST2 was short of. The ability to browse through your clipboard history is defo one of them.  ⌘ + K then ⌘ + VIt’s as simple as that, just go ⌘ + K before hitting your usual ⌘ + V and you’ll be able to pick from your latest clipboard entries.Everything is in the video below, made by Wes Bos, a web dev recently featured on the ShopTalk show of July 27th.    Note, if you want to speed up your development, optimize your ST workflows and become a better developer, Wes has released a book on the subject.",

Good news: it couldn’t be easier.There are installation instructions on the Disqus documentation, and on various places around the web, but I thought I would recap the lot for y’all.  “Great discussions are happening here”… so Disqus says. Unless nothing much will in fact happen, and you’re fine with this.First of all, sign up to Disqus then go there to add Disqus to your site.Then generate a custom script for Jekyll, you’ll need to use the Universal Code option here.Copy your script and paste it into a disqus.html template in /_includes.Make sure you surround the script between the if page.comments and  endif liquid code lines.Then edit your _config.yml file to add the “comments: true” bit…defaults:  -    scope:      path: \"\" # an empty string here means all files in the project      type: \"posts\" # previously `post` in Jekyll 2.2.    values:      author: flo preynat      layout: \"post\"      comments: trueFinally, go to your /_layouts/post.html template and add include disqus.html disqus_identifier=page.disqus_identifier (between liquid handles) below the end of your blog post.You’re done!",

Even less php back end. Hence you’ve got to rely on other ways to get personal messages sent to you.Formspree - Functional HTML formsWhen I stumbled upon Formspree, it did look like the perfect match.Side note: Kudos to the crew that put the site together. Minimalistic, straight to the point and no fuss around the subject.  Just send your form to our URL and we’ll forward it to your email. No PHP, Javascript or sign up required — perfect for static sites!So, formspree is a tool apparently maintained by a community of developers, clearly stating no contents of the form submissions are stored (emails are sent using Mailgun’s API).You do think about privacy, but not for long. First of all, you ain’t giving much away, api or not. Folks are going to initiate discussions in a few words then you take over the talk, privately. No need to be paranoid… especially if (unlike me), you are giving away most of your life to facebook.Easy peasyJust follow the steps described. Everthing works as expected. Add form elements and don’t forget to give them a name, they’ll be automatically taken into account during form submission.",

This could take a while...ERROR:  Error installing jekyll:ERROR: Failed to build gem native extension.It appears that the installation order is vital, and therefore you should try to uninstall ruby, start from a clean situation, and reinstall it.It did fix it for me, so have a try if you’re stuck and you’re a numpty like me when it comes down to gems, CLI, and the rest.Start with:rvm get headrvm resetThen check what’s in there with:rvm listNote what ruby version is installed, in my case it was ruby-2.0.0-p247.rvm remove ruby-2.0.0-p247rvm cleanuprvm repairOnly then go with:sudo gem update --systemsudo gem install jekyllHope this helps.",

But since I managed to do it eventually, a fucking monkey would do it with one hand tied behind his back.Host it on GithubI can host all my stuff on Github and point my repo to a custom domain name in two moves, and I can enjoy what has been my dev workflow for quite a while (Like every modern developer out there, I’ve been versioning all my projects with git and Atlassian’s Bitbucket for years).It’s early days but so far so good.
