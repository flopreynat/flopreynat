        <title>Why Jekyll?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve got it easy on that one. Site is brand new, hence built from scratch, with absolutely no data to migrate/integrate. Picking a technology like Jekyll to build and run this new personal pad was therefore an easy choice to make.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been using Wordpress (most times) and Perch (a few times) to create most of my personal/client/others’ websites, and despite having nagged a few times about performance or bloated code, it was most of the time down to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll is however a static site generator, therefore no database, nor server-side languages are needed, which makes the site lightning fast, and bloody appealing for this particular use case…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Transform your plain text into static websites and blogs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Install was a bit of an experience, epecially if you don’t really know what you’re doing (like me). But since I managed to do it eventually, a fucking monkey would do it with one hand tied behind his back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/jekyll-install.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;jekyll install&quot; title=&quot;Jekyll Install&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;host-it-on-github&quot;&gt;Host it on Github&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can host all my stuff on Github and point my repo to a custom domain name in two moves, and I can enjoy what has been my dev workflow for quite a while (Like every modern developer out there, I’ve been versioning all my projects with git and Atlassian’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://bitbucket.org/&quot;&gt;Bitbucket&lt;/a&gt; for years).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s early days but so far so good. Jekyll seems to be the perfect fit for any developer wanting to enjoy an easy CMS-like setup, just without all the fuss…&lt;/p&gt;
