Data privacy has been a hot subject even before GDPR (25 May 2018) and CCPA (1st January 2020) became officially applicable. 

I actually discussed this very subject [early 2017](http://flopreynat.com/posts/2017-01-03-personal-data-privacy-2017/), discussing the various open source tools I opted for at the time.

Anyway, 2 years on, let's make a quick assessment of what was succesful and kept as well as look into the other tools I am currently using to ensure my data pricacy is in great shape.

### My Data Privacy stack

- **Search engine**: [Duckduckgo](https://duckduckgo.com/) is (still) my preferred and only search engine. It's being used on both my desktop and mobile for a number of years.
- **Mail**: Same applies to [Protonmail](https://protonmail.com/), my favourite (open-source secured) email provider.
- **VPN**: Since we're talking about the Proton team, let's give them another thumbs up with [ProtonVPN](https://protonvpn.com/) offering security, privacy for all, and freedom for journalists and activists.
- **SMS and calls**: [Signal](https://www.signal.org/). *Although I'm experiencing a few issues as I have started using dual-sim phone* , Signal has always been my preferred choice as its messages and calls are end-to-end encrypted. Switch to safe communications, people.
- **Browser**: I use a mix of [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/), [Brave](https://brave.com/), and [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/)
- **File hosting service**: none. At the time I had pushed [Spideroak](https://spideroak.com/) as a great alternative to dropbox & co. I am not using this service since I actually have removed most of my problems by acquiring my own [Synology NAS](https://www.synology.com/en-global). Having your own home server is a game changer.
- **Note taking**: [Boostnote](https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote), great app and open source project, soon to be coming as a mobile app (allegedely).
- **File synchronization**: I currently use [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net/) as my tool of choice for synching my day-to-day files between my mac and my mobile.
- **To do app**: I ditched asana for [todo.txt](http://todotxt.org/). It has everything I need from tagging my tasks, give them a due date, and priority in the most simplistic way, and I use it with [TodoTxtMac](https://mjdescy.github.io/TodoTxtMac/) on my macbookpro, and [Todo.txt for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.c306.ttsuper&referrer=utm_source%3Dtodotxt_website%26utm_medium%3Dcommunity_apps) by Aditya Bhaskar. And obviously, I get my tasks synched via syncthing as mentioned above.
- **Video Streaming**: I'd love not to be using Youtube but since there are so much great content in there, I use [Newpipe](https://newpipe.schabi.org/) on my Android (NewPipe only parses the YouTube website in order to gain the information it needs) and [Freetube](https://freetubeapp.io/), a YouTube client for Windows, Mac, and Linux built around using YouTube more privately.
- **2FA**: I ditched google authenticator to use [Freeotp](https://freeotp.github.io/).	
- **Navigation**: I ditched google maps and waze to use [OsmAnd](https://osmand.net/). It's great for Map Viewing and Navigation for both Online and Offline. I like the vintage look and feel and amount of details in there.
- **RSS**: The good ol' days of leveraging RSS technology should never have disappeared. But it (stangely) is what occurred in my case. I'm back at it, and I use [Vienna RSS](https://www.vienna-rss.com/) for this. Great native macOS Open Source project, that gets the info to me, as opposed to go get it and get tracked.
- **Office softwares**: I've moved away from google docs/sheets/slides to [Libre Office](https://www.libreoffice.org/).
- **Other softwares**: I make the most of the [Framalibre software alternatives](https://framalibre.org/annuaires/logiciel) by the great [Framasoft](https://framasoft.org/en/), and use as a few examples: [Jitsi](https://jitsi.org/) instead of Hangouts/Skype, [Framadate](https://framadate.org/) instead of doodle.

### Yet to test (mytodo)

- **Password manager**: [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/) which I would like to test self-hosted. I'm on another password manager app at the moment, but switching to an open-source solution would be nice.
