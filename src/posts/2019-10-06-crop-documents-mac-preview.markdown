So you want to quickly/cheaply crop a jpg or pdf but have no tools lying around your mac to do so.
There's actually an easy way to do it using Mac's native image and PDF viewer Preview. 

> Command + K

Really handy way if you can't be bothered installing gimp, or alternative.

1. Open the file in Preview
2. Select Tools > Rectangular Selection
3. Draw your selection area on the file
4. Use Command + K to crop the image
5. Save your document 

So long.
