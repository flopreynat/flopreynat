So you boot your macbook pro, and you get... well not much. A black screen staring back at you while you frantically reach for your phone to check possible solutions to this problem.

#### PRAM Reset

Look no further. The thing just happened to me and I managed to get through it by resetting the machine's PRAM, which is - apparently -  a common troubleshooting technique when your favorite apple goes to f***.

It allegedly should be the last resort when this kind of things happen. But as none of the other techniques I managed to find on the net did work, I'm only going to cover this one since, as mentioned above, it did the trick.

So here how it's gotta be done. 

> CMD + ALT + P + R

You reboot the mac, and as soon as you hear the boot-up sound, you hold down the magic key combination displayed above.

I haven't got the slightest idea what the problem was, and why I had to do this.
But it just does work.
