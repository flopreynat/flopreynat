Repetitive strain injury (RSI) is a frequent issue when you spend 10+ hours a day in front of a computer, and it is something I have unfortunately been experiencing these last few years.

Since I own a mac, I have always been using a magic mouse, but as aching in my right hand (and arm) started to occur on a more regular basis, I started wondering whether this beautiful, yet - let's be honest - way too small device was the root of my problem.

> DANGER MOUSE !

Discussing the matter with my osteopath quickly led to the option of using a vertical mouse, helping you  keep your hand in a natural position. This is why I moved to 'verticality' 6 months ago, with the purchase of a basic [usb vertical mouse ZeleSouris](https://www.amazon.fr/gp/product/B00D84P8O8/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o07_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1).

A few reasons why I picked this low-budget mouse:

- this was going to be more like a pilot phase (so I thought)
- non-wireless mice are less heavy (no batteries), hence easier to move
- this specific device was not pricy hence more than worth a shot

6 months on and I have to admit this was the best choice ever. Getting used to it took only a few days as far as I was concerned. I doubt the mouse I picked is the best ever, but my RSI has gone for now.

I can only advise you to ditch the good looks of the magic mouse for an old bulky mouse, a trackpad or a vertical mouse, should you suffer (or wish to prevent) from RSI.
