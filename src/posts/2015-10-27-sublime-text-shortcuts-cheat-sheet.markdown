'Have you documented your own Sublime Text shortcut cheatsheet?' is a question I never get asked. But despite all your efforts to avoid the subject, here it is. In your face!

This post is likely to get updated on a regular basis since I tend to learn new stuff every day. See, when you start low, you're bound to progress more often than never :)

So we've already spoken about [ST3's clipboard history capability](http://flopreynat.com/posts/2015-08-18-sublimetext-clipboard-history/). Here's the rest of the stuff I use on a daily basis.

| Command | Usage |
| --- | --- |
| Command + click | Multiple cursors |
| Command + C/V | (without selecting something) Copy/paste entire line |
| Command + O/S/W | Open/Save/Close file |
| Command + Control + P | Get List of Saved Projects |
| Command + X | Cut Line |
| Command + D | Grab similar occurences |
| Command + Control + G | Grab all occurences |
| Command + Shift + F | Find stuff through files & folders |
| Command + K B | Toggle sidebar |
| Command + K L | Go Lower case |
| Command + K U | Go Upper case |
| Command + Shift + / | Commenting/Uncommenting |
| Command + Control + up/down | Swap line order |
| Alt + drag | Initial a column select |
| Command + Shift + left/right | Select content from cursor to left/right end |
| Control + Shift + W | Wrap Line or Selection with Tag (absolute favourite) |
| Command + Control + Shift +F | Enjoy Distraction-free fullscreen |
| Select + [/( | Wrap selection between parenthesis/brackets |

More to come obviously...

ps: get yourself a [licence](https://www.sublimetext.com/buy), it's only 70 box.
