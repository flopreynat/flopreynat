DuckDuckGo is by far the best search engine out there. For your own privacy for starters, and also as a great little tool for us dev folks, adept of quick tech & code answers, and geeky little features. 

> Smarter Search!

A few tips and tricks that you may not know of. I've been using some for few for months, and only discovered others in the last few days.

#### Navigation

Navigate through search results using Vim Line Navigation
k – navigate upwards
j – navigate downwards

#### Cheatsheets

DuckDuckGo offers a wide range of cheatsheets. Try them out. Just type the language, app, or software of your choice + cheatsheet.
e.g. ["jquery cheatsheet"](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=jquery+cheatsheet&t=ffab&ia=cheatsheet), ["css cheatsheet"](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=css+cheatsheet&t=ffab&ia=cheatsheet), ["javascript cheatsheet"](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=javascript+cheatsheet&t=ffab&ia=cheatsheet), etc

If you wish to look for something on a specific site, like Stack Overflow (!stack + query) or CSS-Tricks (!csstricks + query). The list of bangs is ["here"](https://duckduckgo.com/bang).
Here's a cool one you can try yourselves: ["!caniuse flexbox"](!caniuse flexbox)
