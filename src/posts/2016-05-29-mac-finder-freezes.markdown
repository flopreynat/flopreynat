Another blog post on Apple devices playing up (following the ["boot to black screen"](http://flopreynat.com/posts/2015-12-23-macbook-pro-boots-to-black-screen/) one) with this time, the way to resolve a frozen finder on OSX (Mavericks in my case).

The thing happened to me a few months back, with Finder freezing over and over after a few seconds or minutes of usage, forcing me to force quit Finder on numerous occasions throughout the day.

Fed up with this bug, and not willing to move away from the native file managing app, I eventually got it sorted out by simply using Mac's Safe Mode, something that Windows users might be more inclined to be using on a regular basis.

> Safe Mode baby

I personnally had never used the safe mode before, despite around 10 years on apple.

So if you have a frozen Finder, go for it...

Follow these steps to start up into safe mode.

1. Start or restart your Mac. 
2. Immediately after you hear the startup sound, press and hold the Shift key.
3. Release the Shift key when you see the Apple logo appear on the screen.

After the Apple logo appears, it might take longer than usual to reach the login screen or your desktop. This is because your Mac performs a directory check of your startup disk as part of safe mode.

To leave safe mode, restart your computer without pressing any keys during startup.
