About a year ago, I switched from Sublime to VS Code, and never looked back. The code editor does everything I need, and having the terminal and console closed to your code is a mega plus.

But the other day, cyborg rights activist [Aral Balkan](https://ar.al/), whom I was talking to on Twitter, mentioned to me the existence of **VS Codium**, a  clone of Visual Studio Code, providing its users with the same Microsoft application experience, but without Microsoftâ€™s telemetry code and data usage tracking.

The prospect of using a community-driven, freely-licensed, 100% Open Source, tracking-less version of VS Code was too good to be true, and hence I made the switch and obviously can only encourage you to follow suit if you have yet to make the move.
