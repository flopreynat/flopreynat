Another cool add-on to your Sublime with this great little plugin that allows you to autocomple your file names and speed up your coding. 

Use your [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/) (CMD + SHIFT + P) to install [AutoFileName](https://github.com/BoundInCode/AutoFileName) and start playing with it.

> Autocomplete FTW!

Been using for a long time now, but I reckon it hasn't got the fame it deserves.

Kudos to [@boundincode](https://twitter.com/boundincode) (Liam Cain), the creator behind AutoFileName.
