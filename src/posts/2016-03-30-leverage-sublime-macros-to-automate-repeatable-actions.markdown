Sublime Text Macros are a smart little tool to automate repeatable (and often-repeated) patterns.

For example, I need to build arrays from lists of things on a regular basis. As easy as it can be in sublime to perform such an operation, using the basic automation provided by Macros is the best way forward.

Simply navigate to Tools/Record Macro to record what you want Sublime to do on your behalf, Save your macro with a '.sublime-macro' extension and replay it as much as you need to.
