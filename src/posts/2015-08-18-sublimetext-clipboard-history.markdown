I've recently moved to Sublime Text 3, having enjoyed several years of cruising on version 2. The latest version is now more than mature (hence my move) and has additional features ST2 was short of. The ability to browse through your clipboard history is defo one of them.

>⌘ + K then ⌘ + V

It's as simple as that, just go ⌘ + K before hitting your usual ⌘ + V and you'll be able to pick from your latest clipboard entries.
